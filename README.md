# general-knowledge-Quiz-1
This project is a fun quiz which will test your general knowledge

The quiz itself consists of 6 questions with 4 multiple choise answers. As a whole, it includes a place to create a username, a section about the quiz (rules and rundown), the questions and answer options and a submit button.

I created this project as a fun way to display my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used HTML to create elements such as the title, qustions, username section and buttons. For styling properties I used CSS to place and decorate the webpage by adding colors and getting different sections to be in certain places. For the backend i used JavaScript which i used to display the username and get a score when questions were answered.

## How it works
Start by creating a username which will then be displayed at the top of the screen. After you have completed that, you can read through the rules and a little bit about the quiz. Once you've read through that, you can start the quiz. Read through the questions carefully and select an answer using one of the multiple choise radio buttons. Upon finishing the quiz, press "submit" and your score will be displayed!

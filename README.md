# general-knowledge-Quiz-1
This project is a fun quiz which will test your general knowledge

The quiz itself consists of 6 questions with 4 multiple choise answers. As a whole, it includes a place to create a username, a section about the quiz (Rules and Rundown), the questions and answer options and a submit button.

I created this project as a fun way to display my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used HTML to create elements such as the title, qustions, username section and buttons. For styling properties I used CSS to place and decorate the webpage by adding colors and getting different sections to be in certain places. For the backend I used JavaScript which I used to display the username and get a score when questions were answered.

## How it works
Start by creating a username which will then be displayed at the top of the screen. After you have completed that, you can read through the rules and a little bit about the quiz. Once you've read through that, you can start the quiz. Read through the questions carefully and select an answer using one of the multiple choise radio buttons. Upon finishing the quiz, press "submit" and your score will be displayed!

## why I used it
Colors- The color scheme I used (blues and pinks) was to add a playful and relaxed look to the website. I styled the "next" and "submit" buttons green so they would stand out and because green is connatated with proceeding forward.

Radio Buttons- Radio buttons are a good and easy way to add interactivity to a webpage only letting user select one answer before submitting. 

Submit button- I've already menioned why I styled the submit button green, but with the button as a whole its initial function is to get a score once answering the questions

Favicon- The use of favicons is a fun way to add little images that can also be descriptive. For eample on my first question about when the movie Titanic was released i used a boat icon. 

## what I'd like to do/add in the future
I would like to include more JavaScript into this project for example not make it as static so that only one question appears at a time and to get the next question you have to press the button "next question"
